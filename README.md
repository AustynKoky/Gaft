# Gaft
A python script that uses the Daft API to find all the new listings in a location depending on your bedrooms and price. Once it finds a new listing, it will automatically email the lister with the message you set. We've tested this to help Sully find a home in Dublin while he was in college. We have got lots of replies back.

# NOTICE
This was made for educational purposes and we did not find a home using this. We hold no responsibility for the usage of this, this was designed to learn requests.

# What we learned
We learned how to scrape a mobile API to bypass the recaptcha on the website API. This let us check for new listings frequently and email the listers without having to do the ReCaptcha.

# Inputs
Your name, your email, the email message you want to send to the listers and your phone number.

If you are using this program, please be sure to adjust the location in the getListing function. ID 33 is for Dublin, this should be changed.
